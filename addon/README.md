# PowerView to MQTT bridge: Home Assistant Add-On

This addon provides a bridge between a [Hunter Douglas PowerView
Hub](https://www.hunterdouglas.com/operating-systems/motorized/powerview) and
Home Assistant, via the [Home Assistant MQTT
Integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/mqtt/).

Once you have configured your MQTT service credentials, this addon should
automatically discover your PowerView Hub and import its shades and scenes
via the MQTT integration.
